## ZeroWaste

> Problem.

The problem category is `Global Problems`. As you're aware, pollution, largely caused by plastic, is escalating daily and poses significant health and environmental risks if left unaddressed. Unfortunately, there's currently no system that allows community involvement with additional benefits.

> Our Solution.

We have created ZeroWaste, where you can download the app from the Play Store, and earn rewards for disposing of wastes in your locality from which you can earn recycled materials from our partnerships Non funded organizations. 

Here's how it works:
- Download and sign up for the app, utilizing Firebase for authentication and a microservices architecture.
- Use the in-app feature to snap a photo of your item.
- Receive an estimate of the reward points you'll earn.
- Locate a nearby disposal site.
- Dispose of it and verify, receive reward points that can be redeemed in the in-app store using your wallet.

## 🌐 Setup Local Environment

We have used Expo, so you can have an emulator using Android Studio or you can use Expo Go App in case of Android.

## ✅ Guidelines to run web app locally

- For this app to work, Use these commands to run the application

> `Fork` & `Clone` this project. 

```bash
# to install dependencies 
npm install

```

- You will get a URL, and a QR Code (for scanning in the Expo Go app) and it will automatically start in the emulator if you have set it up.
